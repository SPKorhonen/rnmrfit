\usage{
f_lineshape(object, ...)

\S4method{f_lineshape}{NMRScaffold1D}(object, sf = nmrsession_1d("sf"),
  sum.peaks = TRUE, include.id = FALSE, components = "r/i")
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An NMRScaffold1D object.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to inheriting methods.}

\item{sf}{Sweep frequency (in MHz) -- needed to convert peak widths from Hz
to ppm. In most cases, it is recommended to set a single default
value using nmrsession_1d(sf = ...), but an override can be
provided here.}

\item{sum.peaks}{TRUE to add all individual peaks together and output a
single function, FALSE to output a data frame of functions
that correspond to individual peaks.}

\item{include.id}{TRUE to include id outer column if outputting data frame.}

\item{components}{'r/i' to output both real and imaginary data, 'r' to output
only real and 'i' to output only imaginary.}
}
\value{
A function or tbl_df data frame of functions where each function
        outputs spectral intensity data given a vector input of chemical
        shifts. In the latter case, the functions are stored in a list column
        called f.
}
\description{
This is primarily an internal method that outputs a function (or a tbl_df
data frame of functions), where each function outputs spectral intensity
data given a vector input of chemical shifts.
