\title{Calculate peak areas}
\usage{
areas(object, sf = nmrsession_1d("sf"), sum.peaks = TRUE,
  include.id = TRUE, components = "r/i", ...)

\S4method{areas}{NMRResonance1D}(object, sf = nmrsession_1d("sf"),
  sum.peaks = TRUE, components = "r/i")

\S4method{areas}{NMRSpecies1D}(object, sf = nmrsession_1d("sf"),
  sum.peaks = TRUE, components = "r/i")
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An NMRResonance1D object.}

\item{sf}{Sweep frequency (in MHz) -- needed to convert peak widths from Hz
to ppm. In most cases, it is recommended to set a single default
value using nmrsession_1d(sf = ...), but an override can be
provided here.}

\item{sum.peaks}{TRUE to add all individual peaks together and output a
single area, FALSE to output a data frame of peak area
values.}

\item{include.id}{TRUE to include id as "resonance" column if outputting data
frame.}
}
\value{
A single overall area or a data frame of areas with columns
        "resonance" (optional), "peak", and "area".
}
\description{
Calculate total peak areas based on peak parameters.
}
