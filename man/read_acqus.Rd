\title{Read Bruker acqus parameters}
\usage{
read_acqus(path, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Character string that points to a scan directory.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed into process_jcamp().}
}
\value{
A list made up of nested lists with the processed acqus entries.
}
\description{
Reads the acqus parameters across all acquired dimensions. Data from each
dimension is stored as a separate list item, i.e., list(direct = [acqus],
indirect = [acqu2s]). Since the acqus files are in JCAMP format, the actual
parsing is just a thin wrapper around read_jcamp(), process_jcamp(), and
flatten_jcamp() that reads Bruker scan parameters and puts them in a flat
list.
